# Simpsons Trivia Game

This is a Simpsons Trivia game that utilizes jQuery as well as the concept of timer functions. You can see the use of those functions in the setTimer function and the showAnswer function.

The key to this type of exercise is to build an object of trivia questions and then reference each question's properties for each repetitive aspect of the game.
